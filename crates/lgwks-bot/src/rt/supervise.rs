//! Supervision — background work that cannot leak and cannot run away.
//!
//! A caller writing a bot should be thinking about the bot. They should not be
//! thinking about whether a task outlives its owner, whether a fan-out has a
//! ceiling, whether a `JoinSet` is being drained, or whether a `loop` has an
//! exit. Two failure modes cause almost all of that thinking, and both are
//! designed out here rather than documented away.
//!
//! # Why a task cannot leak
//!
//! Four mechanisms, none of which the caller has to remember:
//!
//! - **Nothing is detached.** [`Supervisor::spawn`] returns no handle. A
//!   `JoinHandle` a caller might drop is the leak; there is no handle to drop.
//!   The supervisor owns completion and exposes it as [`Stats`].
//! - **Nothing grows without a ceiling.** There is no unbounded constructor and
//!   no internal queue: [`Supervisor::new`] takes the in-flight bound, and
//!   [`Supervisor::spawn`] applies backpressure by awaiting a permit before it
//!   spawns. The pending work is the caller's own collection, not a buffer this
//!   module accumulates. [`Supervisor::try_spawn`] refuses instead of growing,
//!   and counts the refusal.
//! - **Completed tasks are reaped.** A `JoinSet` retains a finished task's slot
//!   until it is joined, so a set that is spawned into but never drained grows
//!   with total spawns rather than with live tasks. Every entry point reaps
//!   first, which keeps the retained set at the live bound rather than the
//!   lifetime total.
//! - **Drop stops everything.** [`Drop`] cancels the token and aborts the set,
//!   so a supervisor that goes out of scope takes its tasks with it. There is no
//!   `close()` to forget.
//!
//! No reference cycle is possible either: cancellation links a child **up** to
//! its parent and a parent holds nothing back, so a task holding its token does
//! not keep the supervisor alive. That is [`CancellationToken`]'s design, not
//! this module's, and it is the reason this module adds no `Weak` bookkeeping.
//!
//! # Why a loop cannot run away
//!
//! [`repeat`] is the only loop this module asks a caller to write, and it
//! cannot be written without a [`Budget`]. Every iteration races the
//! cancellation token, so a cancel always wins even against a body that is
//! itself awaiting — the body is dropped, not waited on. [`Budget::Ongoing`] is
//! the unbounded case, and it is bounded in the way that matters: it is
//! cancellation-terminated, not free-running.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use lgwks_bot::rt::supervise::{Budget, Supervisor};
//!
//! # async fn run() {
//! let mut supervisor = Supervisor::new(4);
//! // `Ongoing` is the unbounded budget, and it still ends: the supervisor owns
//! // the token this loop is raced against, and `shutdown` cancels it.
//! supervisor
//!     .spawn_repeating(Budget::Ongoing, |tick| async move {
//!         let _tick = tick;
//!     })
//!     .await;
//! supervisor.shutdown().await;
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Limits
//!
//! [`Supervisor::spawn`] awaits a permit, so a caller that holds the last
//! permits inside a task this supervisor owns can deadlock with itself. The
//! bound is a backpressure contract, not a queue: a caller who wants to keep
//! producing past the ceiling should use [`Supervisor::try_spawn`] and decide
//! what the refusal means.
